EditEvent allows you to easily edit an event without having to type the whole
thing over. You can either use the reference number shown when you list your
defined events or the event name to edit it.  The event is then placed in the
input line so that you have full editing capabilities.

   þ {[1;35mreference number[0m} The number of the event you want to edit.
   þ {[1;35mevent name[0m} The name of the even you want to edit.

NOTE: Events are stored and looked up by the event name. If you edit an event
and you change the name of that event, when you press enter a new event will
be created. This will not erase the event that you had originally edited. If
you wish to remove the original version you need to use /unevent.
