CommandToList lets you send a specific command for each of the items in the
list. For each item in the list as the command is processed the system 
variable $ListItem is filled in with the current item.

   þ List Name - Name of the list to use. 
   þ List Number - Number of the list to use. 
   þ Command - Commands to execute for each item in the list. 

Examples:

@CommandToList(Friends,tell $ListItem Hi) 
Assuming your list had the names Rand and Egwene in it the following text
would be sent: "tell Rand Hi" and "tell Egwene Hi" 

@CommandToList(Stuff,$ListItem) 
The above would simply process each of the items in the list.
