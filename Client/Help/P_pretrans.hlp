Many commands in Mud Master translate variables and evaluate procedure when
the command is executed. An example of this is when you define a macro that
contains a variable -- when you press the macro key the variable gets
translated. Sometimes, however, you will want the macro to store the value of
that variable instead of the variable name itself. PreTrans allows you to
expand variables and evaluate procedures at the time the command is created.

Examples:

/macro [0m{[1;35mf1[0m} {[1;35msay $Var[0m}
When the F1 key is press the variable gets translated.

/macro [0m{[1;35mf2[0m} {[1;35msay @PreTrans($Var)[0m}
In this case, using PreTrans, the variable gets expanded when the macro is
created. If $Var="Bob" the macro created is essentially: /macro [0m{[1;35mf2[0m} {[1;35msay Bob[0m}
