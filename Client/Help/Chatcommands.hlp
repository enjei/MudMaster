ChatCommands is a toggle that enables or disables the ability for a chat
connection to send you commands. You can see if a connection has command sending
enabled by looking at /chat. You will see an A flag if the option is enabled.
Once enabled the other person can send you commands (actions, aliases, events,
etc...).
