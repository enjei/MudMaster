EditBaritem allows you to easily edit a bar item without having to type the
whole thing over. You can either use the reference number shown when you list
your defined bar items or the item name edit it. The bar item is then placed
in the input line so that you have full editing capabilities.

   þ {[1;35mreference number[0m} The number of the bar item you want to edit.
   þ {[1;35mitem name[0m} The name of the bar item you want to edit.

NOTE: Bar items are stroed and looked up by the item name. If you edit a bar
item and change the item name of that bar item when you press enter a new bar
item will be created. This will not erase the bar item that you had originally
edited. If you wish to remove the original version you need to use /unbaritem.
