Format: [1m@arr(array name,row,column)[0m

arr returns the value of a cell in an array.

   þ array name - The name of the array from which you want to get the cell
     value.
   þ row - The row number of the array. This number must be between 1 and the
     number of rows you defined for the array.
   þ column - The column number of the array. This number must be between 1
     and the numer of columns you defined for the array. This third parameter
     is required, even when using a single dimensional array. However, when
     using a single dimensional array, it is ignored.

Examples:

@arr(Targets,1,0)
If Targets is a single dimensional array the column parameter would be ignored
but it required to be there. This would return the value of the first row of
the array Targets.

@arr(Grid,2,4)
If Grid is a two dimensional array, this would return the value of the cell at
row 2, column 4.
