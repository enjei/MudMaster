EditGag allows you to easily edit a gag without having to type the whole thing
over. You can either use the reference number shown when you list your defined
gags or the mask to edit it. The gag is then placed in the input line so that
you have full editing capabilities.

   þ {[1;35mreference number[0m} The number of the gag you want to edit.
   þ {[1;35mmask[0m} The mask text of the gag you want to edit.

NOTE: Gags are stored and looked up by the mask. If you edit a gag and you
change the mask, when you press enter a new gag will be created. This will not
erase the gag that you had originally edited. If you wish to remove the
original version you need to use /ungag.
