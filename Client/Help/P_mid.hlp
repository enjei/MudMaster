Format: [1m@Mid(text,start character,number of characters)[0m

Mid returns a portion of a string. You tell mid what character you want to
start at, and how many characters from that point on. Strings are zero based,
so if you want the very first character in a string the start character would
have to be zero.

   þ text - Text string from which you want to grab a portion.
   þ  start character - The character index of the first character to get.
   þ  number of characters - The number of characters to get.

Examples:

@Mid(Arithon,0,3)
This will get you the same result as using a @Left(Arithon,3). The text "Ari"
would be returned.

@Mid(Arithon,2,4)
Would return the string "itho".
