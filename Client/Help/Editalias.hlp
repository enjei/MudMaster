Editalias allows you to easily edit an alias without having to type the whole
thing over. You can either use the reference number shown when you list your
defined aliases or the shortcut text to edit it. The alias is then placed in the
input line so that you have full editing capabilities.

   þ {[1;35mreference number[0m} The number of the alias you want to edit.
   þ {[1;35malias name[0m} The name of the alias you want to edit.

** NOTE: Aliases are stored and looked up by the shortcut text. If you edit an
alias and change the shortcut portion of that alias when you press enter a new
alias will be created. This will not erase the alias that you had originally
edited. If you wish to remove the original version you need to use /unalias.
