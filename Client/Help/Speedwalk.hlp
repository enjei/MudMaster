Format: [1m/speedwalk [0m{[1;35mon/off[0m}

When speedwalking is on anytime you send a line of text that contains only
movement characters (n, s, e, w, u and d) the client will send the commands one
at a time at a speed determined by the /pace command. If you typed "nnnuws" the
client would walk you north 3 times, up once, west once and finally south.

   þ {[1;35mon/off[0m} Sets the option on or off.
