Format: [1m/statusbarsize [0m{[1;35mlines[0m} {[1;35mwidth[0m}

Sets the statusbar height in lines and the width of each line in characters.

   þ {[1;35mlines[0m} Can be 1 or higher
   þ {[1;35mwidth[0m} Can be  up to 480

Example: Set statusbar to 3 lines with 100 characters on each line.
         [1m/statusbarsize [0m{[1;35m3[0m} {[1;35m100[0m}

The statusbar items are placed on each line based on their position. For example
if you set the width to 80 then items positioned at character 1, 81, 161, 241
would appear as the first items on each of line 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. If
you decrease the number of lines it does not remove the existing items but may
hide them. If you change the width items may get rearranged onto different
lines.
