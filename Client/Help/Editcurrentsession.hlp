With no argument the current session default script file is opened in a text
editor. With a filename that file is opened in a text editor. You can designate
which text editor by adding "Default Editor=drive:\filename.ext" into the
"Defaults" section of the MudMaster2k6.ini file. Without this, the script will
open in notepad.

   þ {[1;35mdrive:\filename.ext[0m} The location and filename of the script file.
   þ {[1;35mfilename.ext[0m} The filename of the script file. This will look in the
     program folder.

Examples:

/editcurrentsession
This opens the current default start up script in a text editor.

Default Editor=C:\Windows\system32\notepad.exe
This sets notepad as the text editor.
