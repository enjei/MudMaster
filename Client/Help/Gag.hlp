Format: [1m/gag [0m{[1;35mmask[0m}

Adds a gag to the gag list. Before the client prints a line of text to the
screen it checks the gag list. If {[1;35mmask[0m} is found in a line of text that line
will not be printed.

   þ {[1;35mmask[0m} This is the text pattern to search for to determine what lines of
     text to gag. The mask can be defined the same way you define the text
     pattern for an action-- using %0 through %9.

/gag [0m{[1;35mGeoff says[0m}
Any lines that have the text "Geoff says" in them will not be seen.

/gag [0m{[1;35mYou hear %0 shout[0m}
Any lines that have the text "You hear <name> shout" will not be seen.
