Format: [1m/event [0m{[1;35mname[0m} {[1;35mfrequency[0m} {[1;35mevent actions[0m} {[1;35mgroup[0m}

Event causes some actions to be taken when a certain amount of time has passed.
{[1;35mfrequency[0m} is the amount of time in seconds to pass before firing the event.
You can create as many events as you like.  Duplicate frequencies are valid;
so you could create several events to fire every 10 seconds.

   þ {[1;35mname[0m} The name of the event.
   þ {[1;35mfrequency[0m} The number of seconds until the event fires.
   þ {[1;35mevent actions[0m} The commands to do when the event fires.
   þ {[1;35mgroup[0m} Optional, see the user guide for help on groups.

Typing /event by itself will list all the events you have defined. When you
list the events you are also shown the time left before the event fires.

001: [0m{[1;35mJumper[0m} {[1;35mF:30[0m} {[1;35mT:14[0m} {[1;35mjump[0m}
This is an example of an event listing. This first parameter is the name of the
event.  F: shows you the frequency you have set for the event.  T: shows how
much time is left before the event gets fired. The last part contains the event
actions to be taken when the event is fired.

/event [0m{[1;35mJumper[0m} {[1;35m30[0m} {[1;35mjump[0m}
This will create an event called Jumper that jumps every 30 seconds.
