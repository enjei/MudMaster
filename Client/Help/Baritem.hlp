Format: [1m/baritem [0m{[1;35mitem name[0m} {[1;35mtext to print[0m} {[1;35mposition[0m} {[1;35mmax length[0m} {[1;35mfore color[0m} {[1;35mback color[0m} {[1;35mgroup[0m}

BarItem adds text to the status bar.

   þ {[1;35mitem name[0m} identifies the item which you can later use to enable or
     disable, modify or delete the item later.
   þ {[1;35mtext to print[0m} is the text you want displayed on the status bar. This can
     either be literal text, or it can be a variable or procedure.
   þ {[1;35mposition[0m} is the column position you want the item to start printing at on
     the bar. The position must be a number between 1 and 160.
   þ {[1;35mmax length[0m} is the maximum number of characters you want this item to
     display. If the text to be printed is longer than the max length, it will be
     truncated. This prevents items from printing over the top of neighboring items.
   þ {[1;35mfore color[0m} Items can have colors separate from the status bar. This can
     be a number from 0 to 15. If you leave both the fore color and the back color at 0, it
     will use the color of the status bar. This parameter is optional and will default to 0
     if you don't specify it.
   þ {[1;35mback color[0m} The background color of the item. Can be a number from 0 to 7.
     This parameter is optional and will default to 0 if you don't specify it.
   þ {[1;35mgroup[0m} Optional parameter. See the user guide on grouping.

You are responsible for making sure your bar items do not overlap. If you
create two bar items that start at position 1,one of them will be overwritten.

Examples:

/baritem [0m{[1;35mTarget[0m} {[1;35m$Target[0m} {[1;35m1[0m} {[1;35m12[0m} {[1;35m11[0m} {[1;35m0[0m}
This will create an item called Target. It will display the value of the
variable $Target. It will start at position 1, have a maximum length of 12. It
will use foreground color 11, and back ground color 0.

/baritem [0m{[1;35mTarget[0m} {[1;35m$Target[0m} {[1;35m1[0m} {[1;35m12[0m}
This creates the same thing as above. The colors have not been specified, so it
will default to using the colors of the status bar.
