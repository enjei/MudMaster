Grouping gives you some extra flexibility in how you manage your command files.

All of the command types can be assigned a group: actions, aliases, events,
lists, tab words, macro, bar items. All of the commands take a group name as an
optional parameter. Once your commands are grouped there are a number of group
commands that make life a little easier.

You can permanently remove all the items in a group from memory with
/killgroup, or temporarily disable all the items in a group with /disablegroup.

Each of the command types has a command for listing only the member of a
specific group. For instance, if you wanted to list all the actions belonging
to the group called "Formation" you could type:

/groupact Formation

This keeps you from having to weed your way through dozens of actions looking
for what you know applies to a formation group. Works with other types of
groups as well, /grouphigh, /groupalias, etc.

You can write all the items of a group to their own command file using the
/writegroup {drive:\filename.ext} {Groupname} command.

Example:

/writegroup [0m{[1;35mColors.mm[0m} {[1;35mColors[0m}
