Call establishes a link with another user using a client with a compatible
chat protocol, such as zMud, TinTin++, etc, as well as other MudMaster users.
If you are connected with another MudMaster user you can chat, transfer
commands and transfer files. The number of people you can be connected to at
one time is limited only by the number of socket connections windows will let
you have.

   þ {[1;35maddress[0m} The address of the person you wish to call. This can be either
     a named address or an IP address.
   þ {[1;35mport[0m} The port is optional. If you don't specify a port number Mud
     Master will use a default of 4050.
