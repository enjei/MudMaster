ResetEvent causes the time elapsed for an event to be reset back to 0. If
instead of passing an event number you pass an asterisk instead, all events
will be reset. You might want to reset all events if you are trying to get
several events to fire at the same time. If you define two events, each to
fire every 10 seconds they are most likely not going to fire at exactly the
same time (since created them at different times). If you reset all the events
they would both be reset to fire in 10 seconds and would fire at the same time
from then on.

   þ {[1;35mevent number[0m} The number of the event you want to reset.
   þ {[1;35mevent name[0m} The name of the event you want to reset.
   þ [1;35m*[0m Will reset all of the events.
