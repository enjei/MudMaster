SendFile send a file to another chat user. The other user has to have transfers
enabled for you first. When a file transfer is in progress the color of the chat
name of the other person is changed (/chat). If the name is green, you are
sending a file to that chat connection. If it is blue, you are receiving a file.
The file transfer is designed to not lag your mudding--which means that file
transfers aren't as fast as ftp.
