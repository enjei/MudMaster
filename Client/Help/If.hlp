Format: [1m/if [0m{[1;35mconditional statement[0m} {[1;35mthen[0m} {[1;35melse[0m}

If commands need to be activated in some fashion in order to be evaluated. Most
commonly you would place an if command inside an action. However, they could
also be place inside an alias or macro. The if command has been modeled after
an if statement in C.

   þ {[1;35mconditional statement[0m} This is a statement that evaluates to either true
     or false. Any statement evaluating to a 0 is considered false, while any
     other result would be considered true.
   þ {[1;35mthen[0m} The commands you place here will be executed if the condition is
     evaluated to true.
   þ {[1;35melse[0m} The commands you place here will be executed if the condition is
     evaluated to false. This paramater is optional.

Operators recognized by if:

   Operator   Description               Operator   Description
   --------   ---------------------     --------   ------------------------
   &&         And                       ||         Or
   ==         Equal To                  =          Equal To
   !=         Not Equal To              >          Greater Than
   <          Less Than                 >=         Greater Than or Equal To
   <=         Less Than or Equal To     ()         Precedence
   !          Negation

Operators are evaluated in this order: (), &&, ||, =, ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=.

Conditional statements or parts of conditional statements can be negated with !
as long as the portion of the statement being negated is surrounded by parentheses.
To use !, it would be something like
/if [0m{[1;35m$0 > 5[0m} {[1;35m/showme {$0 is smaller}[0m} {[1;35m/showme {$0 is larger}[0m}

/action [0m{[1;35m^You are hungry.[0m} {[1;35m/if {$AutoEat = 1} {take food bag;eat food}[0m}
The above would allow you to turn eating on and off. You need to define a
variable called AutoEat and give it a value of 1 when you want eating to be
automatic, and any other number when you want to turn it off.

/action [0m{[1;35m%0 enters the room.[0m} {[1;35m/if {$MeanMode = 1 && $0 = "Atlas" || $0 = "Breedan"} {spit $0}[0m}
Assuming the mud sent the text "<character name> enters the room." each time
somebody entered the room. Each time somebody enters the room the client would
check to see if MeanMode is 1, and that the name of the person who entered is
either Atlas or Breedan, and if it is, would spit on them.
