Format: [1m/highlight [0m{[1;35mmask[0m} {[1;35mforeground color, background color[0m}

Adds a highlight to the highlight list. Before the client prints a line of
text to the screen it checks the highlight list. If [0m{[1;35mmask[0m} is found in a
line of text the colors for that word or words are changed to colors that
you specify.

   þ {[1;35mmask[0m} This is the text pattern to search for to determine what lines of
     text to highlight. The mask can be defined the same way you define the
     text pattern for an action -- using %0 through %9. If the mask does not
     contain any wildcards (%0 - %9) then just the word is highlighted. If the
     mask uses a wildcard, the whole line is changed to the color.
   þ {[1;35mcolor,color[0m} The foreground and background color to change the text to.
     Valid color names are in the table below. If you don't specify a
     background color "back black" will be used.

Color Names

   Foreground Colors:
     black, blue, green, cyan, red, magenta, brown, light
     grey, dark grey, light blue, light green, light cyan, light
     red, light magenta, yellow, white

   Background Colors:
     back black, back blue, back green, back cyan, back
     red, back magenta, back brown, back light grey

/highlight [0m{[1;35mdisarms you[0m} {[1;35myellow[0m}
Any time you see the text "disarms you" it will appear in yellow.

/highlight [0m{[1;35mYou hear %0 shout[0m} {[1;35mwhite,back blue[0m}
Since a wildcard was used in the mask, when the text is found the entire line
will be changed to white on blue.
