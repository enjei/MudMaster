Tab completion is a shortcut to typing hard to remember or hard to spell
words. You manage your tab completion list with the commands: tabadd,
tabdelete and tablist. You can have as many words as you like in the tab
completion list. Tab completion can be especially useful on a player killing
mud where some of the other players' names are hard to spell quickly.

Once a word is added to your tab completion list you can recall it with just
a few of the letters that start the word and a press of the [TAB] key. Words
are stored in the tab list in alphabetical order. Let's say you have the word
"dahnakriss" in your list. You could type the word by typing "d[TAB]". You
need to type enough of the word to make it unique from the other words in the
list. If you had another word in the list that also started with a "d," you
would need to type another letter or two to make sure you got the word
"dahnakriss."
