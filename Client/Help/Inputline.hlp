This is the non-scrolling line at the bottom of the screen where you type your
commands. If the text you type is too long to fit on the screen the text will
scroll as you type.

The input line has many line editing capabilities. The [HOME] key returns you
to the start of the line; the [END] key to the end of the line. The left and
right arrow keys move the cursor. The [INSERT] key toggles the line between
insert and overwrite mode. The [DELETE] key will delete the character under
the cursor.

Pressing the down arrow key will clear the input line.
