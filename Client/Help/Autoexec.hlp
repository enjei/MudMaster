Format: [1m/autoexec [0m{[1;35mcommands[0m}

Autoexec tells the client to execute a specific set of commands once, when the
script is loaded. Typing /autoexec by itself will list all of the autoexec
commands you have defined.

   þ {[1;35mcommands[0m} The commands are the actions you want to take when the autoexec
     fires.

Example:

/autoexec [0m{[1;35m/call 24.24.27.110[0m}
This is the most basic form of an autoexec. It sees the text "/call
24.24.27.110" and then sends the command to the client to initiate a chat
connection to that IP address.

You can also use an alias in place of the exact commands you wish to use.

Removal:

To remove an autoexec first use /autoexec to see the list of current
autoexecs then use /unautoexec with the number of the one to remove.
