The history list keeps track of the last 100 (by default) lines you have typed.
You can scroll through the history buffer by using the up and down arrow keys.
As you scroll through the history list the lines are loaded into the input line
so that you can edit any of the lines before resending them. Scrolling to the
bottom of the list and pressing the down arrow key will clear the input line.
