An alias lets you define some "shortcut" text to execute a command or commands.
Your alias list is checked each time you press enter to send some text to the
mud. If the text you typed is found in your alias list the text from the
commands side of the alias is sent instead.  An alias is only replaced if it is
the first text typed on a line.

   þ {[1;35malias name[0m} This is the shortcut text you want to be able to type to
     execute commands.
   þ {[1;35mcommands[0m} The commands to execute when the alias name is typed.
   þ {[1;35mgroup name[0m} This is an optional parameter. See the user guide on groups
     for help.

Examples:

/alias [0m{[1;35meat[0m} {[1;35mtake food bag[1;32m;[1;35mgobble food[0m}
If you typed "eat" on the input line the commands "take food bag" and "gobble
food" would be sent to the mud instead.

/alias [0m{[1;35mtarg %0[0m} {[1;35m/var Target $0[0m}
You can also use the variable %0 to represent the text typed after the alias
shortcut. In this case the alias is used to quickly set a targeting variable.
Typing "targ Vecna" would set a variable called "Target" to "Vecna"
