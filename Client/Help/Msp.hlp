This tells the client to gather the files for the Mud Sound Protocol.
The On paramter makes MudMaster 2k6 read the filenames in the SOUND path
and all subdirectories. If there are a lot of files this might take a second
or two. It reads in all the filenames because MSP can pass in wildcards to
make the client play random files. It's faster to have a list in memory than
hit the disk looking for all matches of a wildcard.

The Off parameter can be used to temporarily disable MSP.

   þ {[1;35mon/off[0m} Sets the option on or off.
