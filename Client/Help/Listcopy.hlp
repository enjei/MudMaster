Copies an entire list into a new list. If you don't provide NewList it uses the
original name with Copy tacked on. If the old list doesn't exist nothing
happens.

   þ {[1;35mold list[0m} Name of the list you want to copy from.
   þ {[1;35mnew list[0m} Name of the list to copy to.
   þ {[1;35ma or d[0m} A will sort the list in ascending order, D will sort the list in
     descending order.

Examples:

/listcopy [0m{[1;35mKhraitShips[0m}
This will duplicate the list called KhraitShips into a list called KhraitShipsCopy.

/listcopy [0m{[1;35mKhraitShips[0m} {[1;35mOldKhraitShips[0m} {[1;35ma[0m}
This will duplicate the list called KhraitShips into a list called
OldKhraitShips and sort the new list in ascending order.
