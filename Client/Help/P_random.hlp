Format: [1m@Random(Max Number)[0m

Random returns a number between 1 and Max Number.

Examples:

say @Random(100)
Would say a number between 1 and 100.

say @GetItem(Greetings,@Random(@GetCount(Greetings))) Rand!
If you had a list that contained a bunch of different greetings the above would
randomly select one to use.
