Changes displays the latest changes file directly from the MudMaster 2k6
website. It will only update this file once the first time you use this command
unless you restart MudMaster 2k6. If you put a web address as the argument, then
it will retrieve the specified file instead.

   þ {[1;35mweb address[0m} The website to get the text from.

Example:

/changes [0m{[1;35mhttp://MM2k6.sourceforge.net/changes.txt[0m}
This would print out this .txt file on your screen. This is also the current
default.
