Format: [1m/showtoast [0m{[1;35mtext to pop up in taskbar notifier[0m}

Similar to /showme or /showother except that a taskbar notification pops like
toast above the tray when this command is used. The notification pop up is
skinned using a simple bitmap toast.bmp which must be in the same directory
as mudmaster.exe before a session started.

If /showtoast is executed while the toast is already up the new text is added
to the old text.

If you hover the mouse over the toast it will keep the notification in place.

You can create your own custom skins for the popup. It must be a .bmp and be
in the same directory as the mudmaster.exe when a session is opened for it to
be used. Pure green RGB(0,ff,0) is treated as transparent. The text is
displayed center justified with top margin of 40 pixels and side margins of
15 pixels. Text will not display over transparent portions of the skin.
