Format: [1m/removecaption[0m

Removes the title bar and thick borders from the session window.

Example: In a start up script you could have:

/removecaption
to remove titlebar and caption from the current session window.

/autoexec {[1;35m/window {helpview.mms} {/removecaption}[0m}
If you have already opened that session via script the same script would
likely also /window {helpview.mms} {/removecaption} as well to remove
the title bar and thick borders.
