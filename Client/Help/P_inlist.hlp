Returns: 1 if the text is in the list, otherwise 0

InList determines if a specific text string is in a user defined list. InList
can be evaluated in an /if statement. While you can use the list number to
specify a list to search I don't recommend it. If you added a new list it
might change the number of the list are looking for.

   þ list name - The name of the list you want to check.
   þ list number - The number of the list you want to check.
   þ item text - The item you want to search for in the list.

/if [0m{[1;35m@InList(Friends,Rand)[0m} {[1;35msay Rand is in the list.[0m} {[1;35msay Rand is not in
the list.[0m}
If the word "Rand" is in the list called "Friends" the text "say Rand is in
the list." would be sent to the mud, else the other string would be.

/if [0m{[1;35m@InList(Friends,Rand) = 0[0m} {[1;35msay Rand is not in the list.[0m}
Searches for the word "Rand" in the list "Friends" and if it is NOT found the
text "say Rand is not in the list." is sent to the mud.
