Format: [1m@Word(string,word number)[0m

Word returns a specific word from a string. A handy use for this procedure is
passing in multiple words to an alias -- the alias can then easily separate
the different words.

@Word(This is a test,2)
This would return the word "is".

/alias [0m{[1;35mtest %0[0m} {[1;35msay @Word($0,2)[0m}
Typing "test This is a test" would pull the second word out of the string
passed to the alias and produce: "say is"
