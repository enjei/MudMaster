The scrollback buffer keeps track of the last 200 lines to come in from the
mud. The lines are stored in the buffer with their color to make reading easier.
The amount of lines stored can be changed in the Session Options.

You activate the scrollback with [PAGE UP].  [ESC] exits the scrollback.

Using the [CTRL-UP] and [CTRL-DOWN] arrow keys scrolls you through the backup
buffer one line at a time. [PAGE UP] and [PAGE DOWN] are used for a screen at a
time.
