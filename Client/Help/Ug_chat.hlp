Mud Master chat allows you to establish a peer to peer link with another MM
user or chat server. Once you have a connection you are able to talk with
any or all of your chat connections, transfers commands (actions, aliases,
variables, etc...), and transfer files. Peer to peer means the clients are
connected directly. Often you will experience less lag using MM to chat
than you would talking to the same person through a mud.

Before you connect to anybody you need to set your chat name. Everybody you
connect to will see this name when you talk. The command is:
/chatname [0m{[1;35mchat name[0m}.

To start a chat with another person you use the call command and their network
address. Call will accept both IP address and named address. You can see your
IP address in MM in two ways. First, you can type /info. Second, you can use
the procedure @IP(). Example: tell arithon My address is @IP(). Once you know
another user's ip address use call to connect to them. /call 204.120.248.148

Sometimes MM will be unable to reach an IP address when you /call. This is
usually because the person you are trying to call has a firewall. A firewall
prevents remote systems from connecting to an internal network. If you cannot
connect to somebody have them try to call you instead. If you still cannot
connect to each other you may both be firewalled. You can still chat if you
can both connect to another person who is willing to be a chat server for you.

An easy way to get connected with a group of people already chatting is to use
/requestconnects [0m{[1;35mname/number[0m}. Once you connect to a user, you can request
all of their chat connections with this command. MM will then try to connect
you with all of the other user's connections. Only public connections are
returned when somebody requests your connections. If you don't want people to
see some of your connections, flag them as private.

There are several things that can happen when a chat call comes in. You can
prevent people from connecting to you by using the DND (Do Not Disturb)
command. When a call comes in DND is checked, if it is on, the chat connection
is hung up on without interrupting you. /dnd will toggle the option on and
off. You can see the DND status by using /info. Autoaccept also affects how
incoming calls are handled. If you have autoaccept off you will be prompted to
accept the call when it comes in -- this will pause your mudding until you
press Y or N. If you leave autoaccept on chat calls get accepted without
prompting you. You can see the status of autoaccept with /info.

/Chat will show you all the chat connections you have. It also shows you some
status flags associated with the different connections. The flags and a
description of them are listed below. If you are transferring a file thru a
chat connection, the chat name color will change. If the name is blue, you are
receiving a file, if it is green, you are sending a file.

   A - You are allowing that chat connection to transfer commands to you
       (aliases, actions, variables, etc...). /chatcommands [0m{[1;35mname/number[0m} will
       toggle this flag.
   F - Means that chat connection is behind a firewall.
   I - You are ignoring that chat connection. You will not see any chats or
       name changes from that person. /chatignore [0m{[1;35mname/number[0m} will toggle
       this flag.
   P - Private connection. Connections marked as private are not given out
       when somebody requests your chat connections. /chatprivate
       [0m{[1;35mname/number[0m} will toggle this flag.
   S - You are serving this connection. When serving, /chatalls coming from
       people not being served are sent to those you are serving -- text from
       those being served is sent to all of your other connections.
       /chatserver [0m{[1;35mname/number[0m} will toggle this flag.
   T - Allow transfers. You are allowing file transfers from this connection.
       /chattransfers [0m{[1;35mname/number[0m} will toggle this flag.

To talk with a specific connection you use /chat. /chat [0m{[1;35mchat name/chat number[0m}
{[1;35mtext[0m}. Like with the other lists you can use either the name of the
connection, or the number you see when you list your connections with /chat. To
talk with all of your connections at the same time use /chatall [0m{[1;35mtext[0m}.

You can also group chat connections and talk just to that group. Use
/chatgroupset [0m{[1;35mname/number[0m} {[1;35mgroup name} and /chatgroupremove {name/number[0m} to
set and remove group names from a chat connection. Once you have people grouped
you talk to the group with /chatgroup [0m{[1;35mgroup name[0m} {[1;35mtext[0m}. You can also use /cg
as a shortcut for /chatgroup.

Emoting on the chat channel works very similar to the commands used for
chatting. /emote, /emoteall, and /emotegroup. When you emote you chat name and
the text you emote is sent to the chat connection. /emoteall licks you would
send "{[1;35mChat Name[0m} licks you." to all your connections.

To hang up on a chat connection use /unchat [0m{[1;35mname/number[0m}.

If you want to send commands to another chat connection you have to first get
them to enable the reception of commands from you with /chatcommands. Once they
have flagged you able to send commands you can use the following to send them:
/sendaction, /sendalias, /sendarray, /sendbaritem, /sendevent, /sendgag,
/sendhighlight, /sendlist, /sendmacro and /sendvariable. If you want to send a
group of commands use /sendgroup. When you send a list or array, all the items
belonging to the list or array are transfered as well.

To send files through a chat connection you have to get the chat the other
party to flag with allow transfers. Use /sendfile to transfer files. Both
users are notified when a file transfer has been started and notified again
when the transfer is complete. You can check the status of a file transfer with
/filestatus [0m{[1;35mname/number}. The {name/number[0m} refers to the chat connection, not
the name of the file being transferred. /Filecancel [0m{[1;35mname/number[0m} will cancel a
file transfer in progress.

/ChatBack and /ChatFore can be used to change the default colors of the chat
text.

/ChatVersions will show you the version of MM that each of the chat connections
is using.

By default when you start up MM it will listen for chat calls on port 4050. You
can tell MM to listen to an alternate port for each session if you want. You can
change the listen port via the Session menu, Options... or via the Options toolbar
icon. The listen port setting is on the  Chat/Sound tab and is called Chat Port.
The port to used is saved in your session file when you save the changes. You
can see what port MM is listening to with /info. /call uses port 4050 by
default as well. If you change the port that MM is listening to you will have to
let people know which port number to call.
