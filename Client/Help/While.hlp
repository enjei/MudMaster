Format: [1m/while [0m{[1;35mcondition[0m} {[1;35mcommands[0m}

While executes the command as long as the condition is true.

   þ {[1;35mcondition[0m} A condition that evaluates to true or false. See help on if
     for information on the condition.
   þ {[1;35mcommands[0m} The commands will be executed until the condition is false.

Caution is advised when using the while command. It creates a loops that does
not stop until the condition is evaluated as false. If you create a condition
that never evaluates to false it will stay in an infinite loop. An example of
an infinite loop is this: /while [0m{[1;35m1 = 1[0m} {[1;35msay doh![0m} This while will never stop
executing and the program will appear locked up. The idea behind the while is
to create a condition that uses variables. Somewhere in the commands portion
you would set a variable causing the loop to fail.
