GetItem retrieves an item from a list by number.

   þ list name - The name of the list from which you want to get an item
   þ list number - The number of the list from which you want to get an item.
   þ number - The number of the item you want to get.

Example:

@GetItem(Friends,1)
Assuming you had a list called friends, this would give you the first item in
that list.
