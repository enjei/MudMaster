ChatServe toggles the Serve flag of a chat connection. When you serve a chat
connection any /chatalls from that person are sent out to all of your other
connections. Likewise, when text comes in from any of your other connections,
it is sent to anybody being served. This would allow two people who are both
firewalled to still communicate with each other as long as they connected with
another person who can connect to the both of them.

   þ {[1;35mreference number[0m} The number of the chat connection you want to change.
   þ {[1;35mchat name[0m} The name of the chat connection you want to change.
