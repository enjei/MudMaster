The variable command adds a variable to your variable list and assigns it a
value. If the variable is already in the list the value is replaced with the new
value. A variable can be recalled by putting a @Var() around it's name, such as
"@Var(example)". You can also put a $ in front of the variable name to recall
it, such as "$example".

   þ {[1;35mvariable name[0m} What you want to name the variable.
   þ {[1;35mvalue[0m} The value to assign to the variable.
   þ {[1;35mgroup name[0m} This is an optional parameter. See the user guide for help on
     groups.

Example:

/variable [0m{[1;35mTarget[0m} {[1;35morc[0m}
Adds a variable called Target to your list of variables and gives it a value of
"orc".

There are several variables that are defined by the client. The client will let
you if you insist, but you should probably not define variables with these
names. If you do your version of the variable will be found before the system
variable. For a list of system variables see the User Guide.
