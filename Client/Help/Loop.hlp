Format: [1m/loop [0m{[1;35mstart,end,variable name[0m} {[1;35mcommands[0m}

Loop increments or decrements a number from start to end. Each time the number
is incremented or decremented the commands are executed. The loop number is
placed in the system variable $LoopCount.

   þ {[1;35mstart,end,variable name[0m} The start and ending numbers for the loop. If
     start is bigger than end, the loop will count backwards. Variable name will specify
     which variable to store the Loop number in. This can be left blank and MudMaster will
     default variable name to LoopCount.
   þ {[1;35mcommands[0m} The commands to execute for each count of the loop.

/loop [0m{[1;35m1,3,Loop[0m} {[1;35mlook $Loop.man[0m}
This would send the text "look 1.man" "look 2.man" and "look 3.man" to the mud.
Loop number was stored in variable "$Loop".

/loop [0m{[1;35m3,1[0m} {[1;35mlook $LoopCount.man[0m}
This does exactly the opposite. The number is decremented rather than
incremented and would send the text: "look 3.man" "look 2.man" "look 1.man".
Since there was no variable name specified to store the Loop number it is
stored in "$LoopCount".
