The statusbar is a user definable bar at the bottom of the screen. It can be
position either above or below the input line. What gets displayed and in what
colors is up to you. The items can contaid literal text strings, as well as
procedure names that return a value and variables.

If you have a bar item grouped, and you disable that group, the item will not
be drawn on the statusbar. If it is showing at the time it will be removed.

/barfore and /barback control the color of the statusbar. Items added to the
bar can either default to use the statusbar colors, or you can specify
individual colors for each item you add.

/baritemfore and /baritemback can be used to change the color of an item once
it has been placed on the bar.

/baritem is used to add items to the bar and list definitions of the items
already on the bar.

/barseparator puts a vertical bar on the status bar, to visually help you
divide up the items you place on the bar.

/updatebaritem is used to cause the bar item to redraw itself. You would use
this if the bar item has a variable in it and you change the value of the
variable. The item would update with the current value of the variable.

/updatestatusbar is used to update the entire statusbar causing it to redraw.

/baritemshift is used to shift a range of items that are already on the bar to
the left or right. Using this is a shortcut to adjusting the positions of all
the items by hand.

/unbaritem is used to remove an item from the bar.
