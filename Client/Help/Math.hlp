Format: [1m/math [0m{[1;35mvariable for result[0m} {[1;35mmath expression[0m}

The math command lets you perform mathematical equations and place the result in
a variable. Math does integer math only (no floating point).

   þ {[1;35mvariable for result[0m} The name of the variable to place the result in. If
     the variable doesn't exist it will be created.
   þ {[1;35mmath expression[0m} Mathematical expression to be evaluated.

Operator  Description
--------  -----------
()        Precedence
*         Multiplication
/         Division
%         Modulus
+         Addition
-         Subtraction

Anything enclosed in the parens will be evaulated first. Then all the
multiplication, division and modulus operators are evaulated left to right.
Then addition and subtraction are evaluated left to right.

/math [0m{[1;35mresult[0m} {[1;35m3 + 5 * 4[0m}
Would place the number 23 in a variable called "result."

/math [0m{[1;35mresult[0m} {[1;35m(3 + 5) * 4[0m}
Would place the number 32 in a variable called "result."

/math [0m{[1;35mresult[0m} {[1;35m$result + 1[0m}
Adds 1 to variable "result."

/math [0m{[1;35mresult[0m} {[1;35m5 % 3[0m}
The modulus operator returns the remainder of a division as an integer. This
would place the number 2 in the variable "result." 5 divided by 3 leaves a
remainder of 2.
