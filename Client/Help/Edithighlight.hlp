EditHighlight allows you to easily edit a highlight without having to type the
whole thing over. You can either use the reference number shown when you list
your defined highlights or the mask to edit it. The highlight is then placed
in the input line so that you have full editing capabilities.

   þ {[1;35mreference number[0m} The number of the highlight you want to edit.
   þ {[1;35mmask[0m} The mask text of the highlight you want to edit.

NOTE: Highlights are stored and looked up by the mask. If you edit a highlight
and you change the mask , when you press enter a new highlight will be
created. This will not erase the highlight that you had originally edited. If
you wish to remove the original version you need to use /unhighlight.
