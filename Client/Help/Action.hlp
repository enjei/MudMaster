Action tells the client to look for a specific string of text from the mud and
to execute a command or multiple commands when it finds it. Typing /action by
itself will list all of the actions you have defined.

   þ {[1;35mtext pattern[0m} This is the text to look for to trigger the action.
   þ {[1;35mcommands[0m} The commands are the actions you want to take when the action
     is triggered.
   þ {[1;35mgroup name[0m} This is an optional parameter. See the user guide for help on
     groups.

Examples:

/action [0m{[1;35mYou are hungry.[0m} {[1;35mtake food bag[1;32m;[1;35eat food[0m}
This is the most basic form of an action. It sees the text "You are hungry."
and then sends the commands "take food bag" and "eat food" to the mud.

/action [0m{[1;35m^You are hungry.[0m} {[1;35mtake food bag[1;32m;[1;35meat food[0m}
You can 'anchor' an action by starting it with a caret (^). When an action is
anchored the text to search for must be at the beginning of the line.

/action [0m{[1;35m%0 looks at you.[0m} {[1;35msay Hi $0[0m}
%0-%9 are substitution variables that you can use in the trigger side of an
action. They work like a wildcard character but store the text the wildcard
represents for your use. If the mud sent the text "Arithon looks at you." it
would send the command "say Hi Arithon" back. You can use up to 10 (0-9)of
these variables to help you match a text pattern.
