This command allows any script to open another session. Most likely this is
something that would be done in the start up script of the main session but is
not limited to that. Sessions that are opened do not have to connect to any mud
but can be used to display messages or log channels.

   þ {[1;35mdrive:\filename.ext[0m} Path and filename of the session to load.
   þ {[1;35mfilename.ext[0m} Filename of the session to load. This will look in
     the program folder.

Example: In a start up script you could have:

/autoexec {[1;35m/loadsession {C:\Program Files\MyMudMaster\sessionFiles\helpview.mms}[0m}
If you have already saved that session with its position set appropriately and
with its Max Width=1 (checked Max Width in Options, session options) then
you'll likely also want to execute

/window {[1;35mhelpview.mms[0m} {[1;35m/removecaption[0m} as well.
