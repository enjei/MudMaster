MM calculates the volume values based on 16bit or 8bit values. I don't know
how to tell how many bits a sound card supports for the volume control. Right
now I'm assuming if it can play 16bit samples, it has 16bit volume.  If it 
makes a wrong assumption, you can set it with this command. You can test and
see if MM guessed correctly by playing wave at a few dif volume levels and
see if it actually makes a difference in the playback volume. Try 50, 75, 
and 100.
