Editaction allows you to easily edit an action without having to type the whole
thing over. You can either use the reference number shown when you list your
defined actions or the trigger text to edit it. The action is then placed in the
input line so that you have full editing capabilities.

   þ {[1;35mreference number[0m} The number of the action you want to edit.
   þ {[1;35mtext pattern[0m} The trigger text of the action you want to edit.

** NOTE: Actions are stored and looked up by the trigger text. If you edit an
action and you change the trigger portion of that action when you press enter a
new action with that trigger will be created. This will not erase the action
that you had originally edited. If you wish to remove the original version you
need to use /unaction.
