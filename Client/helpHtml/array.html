	<B>Description:</B>
	Array lets you create both single and two dimensional arrays. If you are not
	familiar with arrays, you can think of them like a spreadsheet. A single
	dimensional array would have only 1 column, and as many rows as you specify.
	A two dimensional array would have both rows and columns. Each cell in the
	array would be accessed by giving a row and a column number. In the case of
	single dimensional array, only a row number is needed. Each cell can hold data
	like a variable.
