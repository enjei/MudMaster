<h3>
<b>Modems</b></h3>

<hr>
<br><b>By default Mud Master assumes a Winsock connection. If you want
to use a modem</b>
<br><b>connection you need to add the word modem to the command line when
you run Mud</b>
<br><b>Master. "mudmast modem"</b><b></b>
<p><b>The first thing you need to do is open a com port to use. You do
that with the</b>
<br><b>/openport command. Openport is formatted like this: /openport {com
port}</b>
<br><b>{speed} {data bits} {parity} {stop bits}. Since your port settings
are not</b>
<br><b>likely to change very often it would probably be easiest if you
created either</b>
<br><b>a macro or an alias to hold these settings.</b><b></b>
<p><b>/alias {open} {/openport com1 57600 8 None 1}</b><b></b>
<p><b>Once open port has successfully been called you have access to your
modem.</b>
<br><b>Mud Master is essentially a terminal program from that point on.
You dial just</b>
<br><b>like you would from any other terminal screen: "atdt &lt;number>"
Again, making</b>
<br><b>yourself an alias would be an easy way to take care of this.</b><b></b>
<p><b>/alias {dial} {atdt 555-1212}</b><b></b>
<p><b>The /disconnect command will hang up the modem. /Zap has been modified
a</b>
<br><b>little. If you are using a modem connection it will send the '^]'
character</b>
<br><b>which should abort a telnet connection.</b><b></b>
<p><b>If your dial in account has any VT100 commands for creating menus
and such it</b>
<br><b>will look really messed up. Mud Master translates only color commands.
Also,</b>
<br><b>navigating menus can be difficult -- mud master works by sending
a line of</b>
<br><b>text at a time, not character by character. Two special characters
can be used</b>
<br><b>in the input line, however. Ctrl+C and Ctrl+]. If you need to break
out of a</b>
<br><b>menu you can just press Ctrl+C and then press enter.</b>
