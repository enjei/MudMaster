<h3>
<b>Event</b></h3>

<hr>
<br><b>Format: /event {name} {frequency} {event actions} {group}</b><b></b>
<p><b>Event causes some actions to be taken when a certain amount of time
has</b>
<br><b>passed. {frequency} is the amount of time in seconds to pass before
firing</b>
<br><b>the event. You can create as many events as you like.&nbsp; Duplicate
frequencies</b>
<br><b>are valid; so you could create several events to fire every 10 seconds.</b><b></b>
<p><b><li> {name} The name of the event.</b>
<br><b><li> {frequency} The number of seconds until the
event fires.</b>
<br><b><li> {event actions} The commands to do when the
event fires.</b>
<br><b><li> {group} Optional, see the user guide for help
on groups.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Typing /event by itself will list all the events you have defined.
When you</b>
<br><b>list the events you are also shown the time left before the event
fires.</b><b></b>
<p><b>001: {Jumper} {F:30} {T:14} {jump}</b>
<br><b>This is an example of an event listing. This first parameter is
the name of</b>
<br><b>the event.&nbsp; F: shows you the frequency you have set for the
event.&nbsp; T: shows</b>
<br><b>how much time is left before the event gets fired. The last part
contains the</b>
<br><b>event actions to be taken when the event is fired.</b><b></b>
<p><b>/event {Jumper} {30} {jump}</b>
<br><b>This will create an event called Jumper that jumps every 30 seconds.</b>
