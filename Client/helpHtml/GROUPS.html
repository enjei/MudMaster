<h3>
<b>Groups</b></h3>

<hr>
<br><b>Grouping gives you some extra flexibility in how you manage your
command</b>
<br><b>files. All of the command types can be assigned a group: actions,
aliases,</b>
<br><b>events, lists, tab words, macro, bar items. All of the commands
take a group</b>
<br><b>name as an optional parameter. Once your commands are grouped there
are a</b>
<br><b>number of group commands that make life a little easier. You can
remove all</b>
<br><b>the items in a group from memory with /killgroup, disable all the
items in a</b>
<br><b>group with /disablegroup. Each of the command types has a command
for listing</b>
<br><b>only the member of a specific group. For instance, if you wanted
to list all</b>
<br><b>the actions belonging to the group called "Formation" you could
type</b>
<br><b>"/groupact Formation" This keeps you from having to weed your way
thru dozens</b>
<br><b>of actions looking for you you know applies to a formation group.
Also you can</b>
<br><b>write all the items of a group to their own command file.</b>
