	<h3>Action</h3>
	<HR>
	<B>Format:</B><BR>
	<blockquote>
	/action {trigger} {action} {group name}
	</blockquote>
	<B>Description:</B><br><br>
	Action tells the client to look for a specific string of text from the mud
	and to execute a command or multiple commands when it finds it. Typing 
	/action by itself will list all of the actions you have defined.
	<UL>
	<LI>{trigger} This is the text to look for to trigger the action. </LI>
	<LI>{action} The commands are the actions you want to take when the action is triggered.</LI>
	<LI>{group name} This is an optional parameter. See the user guide for help on groups.</LI>
	</UL>
	</P>
	%0-%9 are substitution variables that you can use in the trigger of an
	action. They work like a wildcard character but store the text the wildcard
	represents for your use.
	<P>
	<B>Examples:</B>
	<blockquote>
	/action {You are hungry.} {take food bag;eat food} 
	</blockquote>
	This is the most basic form of an action. It sees the text "You are 
	hungry." and then sends the commands "take food bag" and "eat food" to 
	the mud. 
	<blockquote>
	/action {^You are hungry.} {take food bag;eat food} 
	</blockquote>
	You can 'anchor' an action by starting it with a caret (^). When an action
	is anchored the text to search for must be at the beginning of the line. 
	<blockquote>
	/action {%0 looks at you.} {say Hi $0} 
	</blockquote>
	If the mud sent the text "Arithon looks at you." MudMaster 2k6 would send the command "say Hi Arithon" back. 
	You can use up to 10 (0-9) of these variables to help you match a text pattern.
