<h3>
StatusBar</h3>

<hr>
<br>The statusbar is a user definable bar at the bottom of the screen.
It can be up to 160 characters wide and the font used can be set in the
Session, Options... menu. It can be
position either above or below the input line. What gets displayed
and in what
colors is up to you. The items can contain literal text strings,
as well as
procedure names that return a value and variables.
<p>If you have a bar item grouped, and you disable that group, the item
will not
be drawn on the statusbar. If it is showing at the time it will
be removed.
<p><b>/barfore</b> and <b>/barback</b> control the color of the statusbar. Items added
to the
bar can either default to use the statusbar colors, or you can specify
individual colors for each item you add.
<p><b>/baritemfore</b> and <b>/baritemback</b> can be used to change the color of
an item once
it has been placed on the bar.
<p><b>/baritem</b> is used to add items to the bar and list definitions of
the items
already on the bar.
<p><b>/barseparator</b> puts a vertical bar on the status bar, to visually
help you
divide up the items you place on the bar.
<p><b>/updatebaritem</b> is used to cause the bar item to redraw itself. You
would use
this if the bar item has a variable in it and you change the value
of the
variable. The item would update with the current value of the variable.
<p><b>/baritemshift</b> is used to shift a range of items that are already
on the bar to
the left or right. Using this is a shortcut to adjusting the positions
of all
the items by hand.
<p><b>/unbaritem</b> is used to remove an item from the bar.
