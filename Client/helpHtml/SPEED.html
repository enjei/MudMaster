<h3>
<b>Speed</b></h3>

<hr>
<br><b>Running Mud Master from the Windows 95 Explorer will cause it to
run slow.</b>
<br><b>You will be much better off if you go to a DOS shell and run the
program from</b>
<br><b>there. Or make a DOS shell icon for Mud Master and play around with
the</b>
<br><b>properties to give it more system time. You can turn the idle sensitivity
all</b>
<br><b>the way down to LOW to give it a little more time.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Mud Master is a console mode application. Which means it looks like
a DOS app</b>
<br><b>but isn't really. You will find that running it in text mode is
much faster</b>
<br><b>than running it in a window. If it is running in a window you can
press</b>
<br><b>[ALT]+[ENTER] to switch to text mode.</b>
