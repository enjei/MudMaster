<h3>
<b>Tab Completion</b></h3>

<hr>
<br><b>Tab completion is a shortcut to typing hard to remember or hard
to spell</b>
<br><b>words. You manage your tab completion list with the commands: tabadd,</b>
<br><b>tabdelete and tablist. You can have as many words as you like in
the tab</b>
<br><b>completion list. Tab completion can be especially useful on a player
killing</b>
<br><b>mud where some of the other players' names are hard to spell quickly.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Once a word is added to your tab completion list you can recall it
with just</b>
<br><b>a few of the letters that start the word and a press of the [TAB]
key. Words</b>
<br><b>are stored in the tab list in alphabetical order. Let's say you
have the word</b>
<br><b>"dahnakriss" in your list. You could type the word by typing "d[TAB]".
You</b>
<br><b>need to type enough of the word to make it unique from the other
words in the</b>
<br><b>list. If you had another word in the list that also started with
a "d," you</b>
<br><b>would need to type another letter or two to make sure you got the
word</b>
<br><b>"dahnakriss."</b>
