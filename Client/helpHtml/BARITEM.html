		<h3>
			Baritem</h3>
		<hr>
		Format: /baritem {item name} {text to print} {position} {max length} {fore 
		color} {back color} {group} 
		<P>BarItem adds text to the status bar.
		<ul>
			<li>
			{item name} identifies the item which you can later use to enable or disable, 
			modify or delete the item later.
			<li>
			{text to print} is the text you want displayed on the status bar. This can 
			either be literal text, or it can be a variable or procedure.
			<li>
			{position} is the column position you want the item to start printing at on the 
			bar. The position must be a number between 1 and 160.
			<li>
			{max length} is the maximum number of characters you want this item to display. 
			If the text to be printed is longer than the max length, it will be truncated. 
			This prevents items from printing over the top of neighboring items.
			<li>
			{fore color} Items can have colors separate from the status bar. This can be a 
			number from 0 to 15. If you leave both the fore color and the back color at 0, 
			it will use the color of the status bar. This parameter is optional and will 
			default to 0 if you don't specify it.
			<li>
			{back color} The background color of the item. Can be a number from 0 to 7. 
			This parameter is optional and will default to 0 if you don't specify it.
			<li>
			{group} Optional parameter. See the user guide on grouping.
		</ul>
		You are responsible for making sure your bar items do not overlap. If you 
		create two bar items that start at position 1,one of them will be overwritten. 
		<P>/baritem {Target} {$Target} {1} {12} {11} {0}<br>
		 This will create an item called 
		Target. It will display the value of the variable $Target. It will start at 
		position 1, have a maximum length of 12. It will use foreground color 11, and 
		back ground color 0.
		<p>/baritem {Target} {$Target} {1} {12}<br>
		 This creates the same 
		thing as above. The colors have not been specified, so it will default to using 
		the colors of the status bar.
