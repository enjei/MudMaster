<h3>Loadsession</h4>
Format: /loadsession {path and filename of session file}
<p>This command allows any script to open another session. Most likely
this is something that would be done in the start up script of
the main session but is not limited to that. Sessions that
are opened do not have to connect to any mud but can be used
to display messages or log channels.</P>
<p>Example: In a start up script you could have:
<blockquote>
/autoexec {/loadsession {C:\Program Files\MyMudMaster\sessionFiles\helpview.mms}}
</blockquote>
If you have already saved that session with its position set appropriately
and with its Max Width=1 (checked Max Width in Options, session options)
then you'll likely   also want to execute /window {helpview.mms}{removecaption} as well.
