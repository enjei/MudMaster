<p><b>ChatServe toggles the Serve flag of a chat connection. When you serve
a chat</b>
<br><b>connection any /chatalls from that person are sent out to all of
your other</b>
<br><b>connections. Likewise, when text comes in from any of your other
connections,</b>
<br><b>it is sent to anybody being served. This would allow two people
who are both</b>
<br><b>firewalled to still communicate with each other as long as they
connected with</b>
<br><b>another person who can connect to the both of them.</b><b></b>
<p><b><li> {reference number} The number of the chat connection
you want to change.</b>
<br><b><li> {chat name} The name of the chat connection
you want to change.</b><b></b>
